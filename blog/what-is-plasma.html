								## What is plasma and why are you willing to spend your life looking at it?

								If you are a human being going about your life on earth, there is an astoundingly high probability that you are not a plasma physicist. That is more than ok: the world only needs so many of us roaming around, especially given the rate at which we like to blow stuff up. But that also means that the majority of people have no idea what we as a community study or why. I'm here to break down that barrier a smidge in this first post.
								
								So what even is plasma? You may have heard the word in a few scattered contexts. Perhaps blood plasma and plasma screen tvs? You may have even heard of it in school when they taught you the states of matter: solid, liquid, gas, and ~*plasma*~- the last of which my teachers kindly explained to me by referring me back to the plasma screen tv, which just made me think plasma was made of tvs. They were right in one aspect, though: plasma *is* the fourth state of matter. It's easy to think of it as the natural evolution of adding more and more energy into material: If you dump energy into a solid, you get a liquid (i.e. heating ice to make water). If you dump in more energy, you get a gas (boiling water turns it into steam). But trying to think about heating up gas isn't quite as intuitive. Now we have to know a little bit more physics. When you dump enough energy into gas, any molecules will first rip apart into individual atoms, and then the atoms will begin to have their electrons ripped from their nuclei. This is because the electrons are bound to the nuclei by the attraction of their electric charges. But if you overwhelm that potential energy by dumping in a bunch of kinetic energy, then off they go! It's like pushing a ball out of a pothole; once you push with enough energy to get it over the edge, it's out of there.

								The reason most people don't know about plasmas is that they don't really *occur* on *earth* often. Aside from lightning and fire, most matter we interact with is in a pretty low-energy state. 
								 

								So plasma is just a gas that gets hot enough to rip off some or all of its electrons? Yep! It's a big ol' ion soup.
