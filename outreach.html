								<h3>Research Experience for High school students (REH)</h3>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/students-optics.jpg" alt="Students setting up a laser experiment" /></span>In the summer of 2020, in the midst of full-blown panini lockdown, the Gourdain lab took a leap into the world of building meaningful, long-term connections with the local Rochester community through a program we named the REH: Research Experience for High school students. This is a nod to the NSF-funded "Research Experiences for Undergrads (REU)" that are popular and well-respected across disciplines and institutions. REUs are paid, immersive research experiences that last an entire summer in which a student takes on a significant research project, and is often a direct stepping-stone to getting into a graduate research program. We decided to design our outreach program with this model in mind, but we scaled the length down to a month and set the goal of providing positive exposure to physics research for students. The students would also learn some great research skills that could be applied if they decided to continue research in college. </p>
                <p>For the first summer, due to the lockdown we operated completely virtual, meeting with the students once or twice a day on Zoom. These meeting times were used to teach the students about our lab's research, show research talks from professors, teach them basic python coding, and work on mini data analysis projects. We had nine students total, assigned in groups of three to one of the graduate student mentors in my lab (myself, James Young, and Imani West-Abdallah). At the end of the "internship," each of the groups presented their findings to each other and the members of the Gourdain lab. We kept in touch with these students after the month-long internship, checking in and offering support in applying to college.</p>
                <p>For the second summer (2021), we stepped up the program another level (or five). The students were now in person five days a week and would be completing 5 weeks of paid work/education. We supplemented the Intro to Python workshop with a number of other research skill workshops, including 3D CAD modeling and circuitry. The students also participated in career development workshops, graduate and undergraduate research talks, and lab tours weekly. We also expanded the program into another research group, the Blok lab, which studies quantum information. Students worked in the lab in-person for a couple hours every day in pairs this time with their graduate mentors; myself, Imani, and a third group in the Blok lab: Ray Parker and Mihirangi Medahinne Gedara. Each group worked on a separate experimental physics project in which the students gathered data and performed analysis.</p>

								<h4>Python for High School Students: A Crash-Course in Three Days</h4>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/sine_fit_plot.png" alt="Fitting a sign curve to image data"/></span>Coding is an essential tool for most scientists today, so we decided to focus one week of the internship on teaching the students Python. Rather than build a curriculum for this crash course from scratch, I opted to base this course on an <a href="https://github.com/jbchampagne/pythontutorials">undergrad-level astronomy python minicourse</a> that one of my friends, graduate student Jackie Champaign, taught when I was an undergrad at UT Austin. I took the base content of the first three days of her course and simplified the math/explanations to a high school level, adding more emphasis on concrete examples and developing comfort with syntax. No prior coding experience was assumed for the students in the course, and each lesson was taught in about 2 hours.</p>

<p?In order to avoid entering the infamous software installation hell with our high school students, all of whom were remote the first year of the internship, these notebooks were built to be run via Google Colaboratory (Colab), which is essentially a cloud version of the Jupyter notebook. The only downside to this solution is that Colab doesn't save any files that you upload to load into your code, so they have to be re-uploaded every time the kernel clears. Other than that minor difference, these notebooks run the same as Jupyter notebooks, and can be downloaded and run in Jupyter offline with no changes.</p>

<p>The course is quite condensed, but provides basic working understanding of handling data in python. Each lesson has interactive questions within the "lecture," so instructors should pause and let students work these problems individually or together as you go along. The solutions to these problems are in the "solutions" directory. Here is a summary of the contents of each day's lesson:</p>
