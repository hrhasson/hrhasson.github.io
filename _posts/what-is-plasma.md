## Hello there

If you made it here, you're probably a close friend or family member. In that case, there is a high probability that you don't really understand what the heck it is that I actually do as a graduate student. Let me start from the start: **I am a plasma physicist.**

"But Hannah," you halt me in my tracks, "what on earth is a plasma?" 

The reason most people don't know about plasmas is that they don't really *occur* on *earth* often. Aside from lightning and fire, most matter we interact with is in a pretty low-energy state. You may remember in school they teach you the phases of matter: Solid, liquid, gas. And Plasma?

Yes, plasma is the fourth state of matter! It's easy to think of it as the natural evolution in this sequence: If you dump energy into a solid, you get a liquid (i.e. heating ice to make water). If you dump in more energy, you get a gas (boiling water turns to steam). But thinking about heating up gas even more isn't quite as intuitive. Now we have to journey to atomic scales to think about what is happening. When you dump enough energy into gas (let's just assume monatomic gas), the atoms will begin to have their electrons ripped from their nuclei. This is because the electrons are bound to the nuclei by the attraction of their electric charges. But if you overwhelm that potential energy by dumping in a bunch of kinetic energy, then off they go! It's like pushing a ball out of a pit; once you push with enough energy to get it over the edge, it's out of there.

So plasma is just a gas that gets hot enough to rip off some or all of its electrons? Yep! It's a big ol' ion soup.
